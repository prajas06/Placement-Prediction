PLACEMENT PREDICTION PROJECT USING MACHINE LEARNING

OVERVIEW: This project aims to predict student placement outcomes based on various academic and demographic features like CGPA, MARKS, INTERNSHIPS, PROJECTS etc. Using multiple machine learning models, the system determines the probability of a student getting placed, thereby helping students understand key factors influencing placement success.

MODELS USED:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
DATA PROCESSING & VISUALISATION:

Python Libraries Used- a. NumPy – Numerical computations 
                       b. Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing 
                       c. Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Graphical Representations- 
                       a. Correlation Matrix – Identifies relationships between features 
                       b. Pairplot – Visualizes pairwise feature distributions
